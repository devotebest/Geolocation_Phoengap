I move in and out of the landscape, seeing both and holding them both. Art like walking, is an exploration, can feel euphoric or fearful. Is full of choice and accident, decision and procrastination but essentially discovery. I feel alive in movement and stillness.<br /><br />When walking I collect marine debris from the beaches both natural and man made but especially plastic. I order and re-order, alter, wrap, melt, transform and record. I show work as photographs, installations, paintings and assemblages. An embodied process from walking to image.",

His work has slowly progressed from simple, modelled,brightly glazed earthenware to more complex, subtlely textured and coloured pieces.<br /><br />Working with stoneware and earthenware clays (mainly raku-fired), John now designs and makes a diverse and unique range of decorative ceramic forms such as clocks,stylised creature figures,vases, bowls etc.<br /><br />His work is individual,tactile and lovingly crafted, often influenced by Art Deco style and form and the natural world.

I’ve created hundreds of my own designs over the years, and have had 4 booklets of my work published by the BOS. I focus on the natural world and subjects close to me, often with a humorous angle. Current subjects revolve around Bristol with scenes of the city and subjects such as Wallace & Gromit and Shaun the Sheep. I also like making use of recycled and upcycled paper, including old leaflets, posters and flyers. I take private commissions, run workshops, and am available for media work, functions and shows. My origami motto is “Keep folding, Keep Smiling” and my website Smiley Origami reflects my approach to this fantastic and flexible art.",

        description_long: "Linda has always been interested in texture and surface in her work and has been increasingly drawn to using clay as her medium of choice. She finds the versatility and expressive possibilities of clay to be endless and that there is always something new to learn.<br /><br />Linda draws on her experiences of travel and love of African Arts to inspire sculptural pieces based on human forms. She uses traditional hand building methods to construct her work. Slab building, coiling and pinching techniques are used to make each unique piece. Linda uses a coarse crank stoneware clay for its colour, strength and texture, enabling her work to be placed safely outdoors. She decorates her work with coloured slips, small amounts of glaze, beads and shells.<br /><br />In addition to her large scale work Linda makes ‘facepot’ vessels and plantpots, small cat sculptures and ‘Yogacats’, each one individually made and performing various yoga positions.",

This has become a bit of a classic, and is still very popular.<br /><br />Simple shapes and bold colours form the basis of the ‘Contrast Block colour’ collection.  The strong geometric shapes make it a striking piece of jewellery and the exposed copper gives it a warm glow.<br /><br />My ‘expansion’ range allowed me to explore the spontaneity and experimental nature of enamel.  Layers of enamel were built up with varying melting points.  Once heated this allows for the flow of enamels giving each piece a unique sense of movement.",

I have made etchings based on scenes from Shakespeare and other playwrights and a set of prints to do with the Spanish Civil War.<br /><br />I paint in oil and watercolour, the former generally reflecting similar subject matter to the prints, the latter have been mainly paintings of life models.  I find the challenge of the complex processes involved in printmaking fascinating but I also love the greater directness involved in painting.",

        description_long: "My working practice concentrates on sculpture and public art. Work encompasses abstract and contemporary figurative sculpture with the overriding aesthetic being minimal, emphasising the form with strong lines. I am looking for a spiritual calm, a moment to reflect in a busy world. Presence is sometimes being represented by absence, memory by a trace, stillness by restrained form. I have undertaken many public artwork across Bristol – in hospitals, health centres, parks, cycle paths and schools also other public commissions around the country. My recent series of work explore Islamic Art in contemporary sculptural form exploring spirituality, inter-faith dialog and pluralism. The sculptures combine themes found in Islamic Art –symmetries found in nature, the geometric motifs in the tiling and engraving and the architecture of Mosques and then reinterpret these design elements in contemporary sculptural form.",

Most of my work so far has been commission-based... one thing I’ve noticed is that people seem to like to have themselves painted into famous paintings!<br /><br />I’m really looking forward to the trail and I hope to be able to meet plenty of people who have an interest in art.

Diving is a particular passion of hers, which is a visible influence in her collection where she embraces the colours and lines seen in fish. Line has always been an important part of her style, using it to create interesting, fluid forms. Jasmine enjoys experimentation and so the exhibition includes detailed lotus leaf paintings, two toned line paintings in contrasting colours, photographs and T-shirts.",

The impact of 9/11 is reflected in \"Stuck in a memory you can't get out of\" which partners an earlier work \"Before Ground Zero\".

The images originate from an emotion inspired by a piece of writing or as an immediate response to the natural world.<br /><br />Clare works out of Spike Print Studio, Bristol.  Her recent highlights are that her screenprint, ‘Late Afternoon’ was exhibited in the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in London and from that was chosen by Norman Akroyd CBE RA as one of four U.K. Printmakers to take part in his ‘Original Print Show’ at the Zillah Bell Gallery this September. Her most recent work is in the current RWA Open Exhibition.<br /><br />Clare’s limited edition prints are the result of her life and printing experiences, they capture a simplicity and beauty that buyers find accessible and calming.",

It’s a constant source of interest and surprise.<br /><br />‘The glass itself is the palette – the nature of the sea, the way the colours seem to be contained within the waves, suspended in that moment just before or after the wave has fallen – it just seems to work beautifully in glass.<br /><br />'When I go to the sea, it reminds me of my humanity. Painting it allows me to be caught up in a bigger thing and encourages me to look hard for beauty and the elusive quality that is life itself. And it is very beautiful.’",

Inspired by some wonderful local enamelists and an endless curiosity on my part,I have produced a varied range of enamelled bowls, leaves and jewellery to be found now on every continent.<br /><br />My current work includes jewellery, on both copper and fine silver: earrings, pendants, brooches, cufflinks. As you will see, my range is ever changing. I particularly love enamelling small copper bowls. As I fire some of the enamel designs at the highest temperatures, the effects can be stunning. I call the abstract enamel design series my ‘Paintings in a Pot’.",

Maita is also a busy classical solo singer and qualified dressage judge! After completing the Foundation Art course at Queen's Road, Maita was introduced to  Spike Print Studios, where she was inspired to create very large monoprints and was included in several exhibitions! Maita's current art work has developed out of her need to do something fun and inventive which fits in with her busy life. She creates unique, one off cards and small art works with low tech printing techniques; cutting and collaging images using recycled materials and including beautiful Japanese and hand marbled papers. Maita loves creating quirky and humorous images which express her sense of design and humour. Maita's work can be found at Room 212, the cornucopia of Bristol artists on the Gloucester Road. She also exhibits on the West and North Bristol art trails.",

Every mixed media piece is individually created using all sorts of collected ephemera; wires, watch parts, chain, pearls and beads, and the fabric is hand painted in my kitchen. My embroidered work is sewn onto ecodyed cotton, dyed in my kitchen, using food and leaves from my house and garden - from onion skins and black beans, to bay leaves and ivy.

The natural world provides an unlimited source of inspiration - the dynamics and tensions between different bird or animal groups are often a reflection of human social interactions. She works on white cotton fabric using traditional wax pens, wax and dyes building up layers to give depth and colour. Jo also produces etched glass to commission using wax as a resist before sandblasting. Jo has exhibited widely in the West Country and at SWLA open exhibition in London. Her numerous commissions include several health centres, Swift Computing and private clients. She also teaches batik and runs community and school workshops producing large batik banners.",

Currently my subjects revolve around Bristol with origami scenes of the city and subjects such as Wallace & Gromit and Shaun the Sheep. I also take private commissions, run workshops and classes, and am available for media work, functions and shows.

Using these varied approaches I have been exhibiting on and off since 1980 and have been on the North Bristol Arts Trail for four years. Having lived in Japan for twelve years I am still influenced by Japanese art and this influence fades in and out of my work. My artistic work include the history of art and I have recently successfully completed an MA in Art History at Bristol University. I find this knowledge informs and stimulates my work. Although I find all media available for use, sometimes I concentrate on one particular medium - right now my focus is on etching. I am currently a member of Spike Island Print Studios and have been focussing on etching, particularly the use of aquatint. This year I will be focussing the main part of my work on etchings produced at Spike Island and this will compose the bulk of my exhibition.",

Once Mary has cut out the lino plate with her desired image she rolls it with ink and prints it using thick, dampened ‘Somerset’ paper, rolled through an etching press. This gives the print an embossed finish where the paper has been pressed into the lino. Mary likes to experiment with printing over existing material such as old book pages, old bank notes, old music, old maps, stamps, brown paper – almost anything. The prints are often then embellished further by applying watercolour or gold leaf by hand. A combination of hand printing and using unique material in each of Mary’s prints means that no two prints are exactly the same – each print is a unique piece of art. Mary's prints are available all year round at Room 212 on Gloucester Road.",

I like to think that these creatures all have a secret life that we know nothing about. I keep a notebook to jot down unusual names or lyrical phrases as these can often lead to an idea but it's more likely that I will be inspired by a story or situation that tickles me. I enjoy using large areas of flat bold colour which can be achieved by the screen printing process. Drawing, patterns and textures are all integral to my work and reflect my design background. I start my design process by arranging paper stencils and cut-outs until I am happy with a composition. I use scissors and a scalpel as much as I do pencils for drawing. I have worked with clients including Ikea, Marks &amp; Spencer and John Lewis and am currently working on 6 children's books with a leading British publisher.

During these early days I was working for several galleries, charities and arts organizations having completed a degree in Fine Art. Initially making jewellery allowed me to continue my passion for creating artwork - this quickly turned into an obsession as I discovered how versatile it can be working in metal and creating pieces of art to wear. Having had formal training in fine art rather than jewellery or metalwork has allowed me to be both experimental and liberated. This changes my expectations and allows me to challenge my abilities. I am excited by the environment around me and Bristol is a rich source of inspiration for my work. I am continually taking photos and mark-making as a way of developing new ideas. I am mostly drawn to texture, form and negative space which allows me to create simple, elegant designs. The jewellery and metalwork pieces are often created in tandem, with one influencing the other. Each design is carefully handcrafted which ensures that every item is unique.",

I make mirrors and lamps from beach glass and all sorts of strange found objects; shards of medicine bottles, clay pipes, old nails and broken plates, even animal teeth. I love looking down at the detritus of the past, collecting remnants and then making new from old - reclaiming the time when those scraps belonged to possessed, handled, and cared for items. But I also use new scrap glass; the edges of coloured glass sheets, to make mosaic, and ordinary window glass to make kitchenware. Inspired by my beach combing trips I use small pieces of plain glass for painting seascapes in the same church paints that have been used for hundreds of years. I sell my homewares on the art trail and also take commissions.",

The traces that are created in a moment's action and the traces that are built up over time are the two elements I find particularly interesting. I start each piece by creating a set of rules that determine where the marks go and consequently these rules are responsible for the result. Minor differences at the start affect what follows in slightly unpredictable ways, similar to the effects seen in chaos theory. Each small mark may look insignificant, but as the marks build up, they form something much more substantial. I liken this to the passage of time, where each second is small but over millennia mountains can form.",

Initially I was using life drawing as the main subject matter and some animal quick sketches but this year I have begun exploring rooms as subject matter and will be showing the first of these.

I have worked with a range of natural materials such as willow, cane and rush, and man-made and recycled materials such as paper, card and packing tape. I am currently growing 26 varieties of willow locally. The cycle of weeding, cutting and sorting the willow is time consuming but I am now weaving with beautiful willow and experimenting mixing the hues of the different varieties. This year I have been making plaited border baskets and log baskets and I have experimented with Catalan style baskets with found materials and roped borders. Christmas projects include decorative small Christmas trees and willow reindeer. 2017 will be my sixth trail as a full member of the North Bristol Artists and I will be showing in my own venue along with artists Robin Page and Thomas Page.

            description_long: "I grew up in Devon, on the edge of Dartmoor, and have always loved the moorland, coasts and wild flowers of Devon and Cornwall. These places, along with Guernsey, still provide much of the inspiration for my work. I have always loved drawing, painting and creating, initially working mainly in textiles, and later moving to stained glass and watercolour painting. It was only after taking early retirement from teaching that I was able to pursue painting more seriously, attending classes and trying other media. I have been inspired by many artists, and enjoy experimenting with new styles and techniques. I also have a wide range of cards, small pieces of stained glass, and textile gifts. I only exhibit with North Bristol Artists, but can be contacted via my website, through which I will soon be selling cards.",

            description_long: "Born into an artistic family, Maita Robinson has spent a lifetime pursuing artistic endeavours. She's had several exhibitions in different disciplines over the years including painting, mixed media, and printmaking. She also trained as a ‘classical’ animator at Vancouver Film School and made short films which have been screened at international film festivals. Maita is also a busy classical solo singer and qualified dressage judge! After completing the Foundation Art course at Queen's Road, Maita was introduced to  Spike Print Studios, where she was inspired to create very large monoprints and was included in several exhibitions! Maita's current art work has developed out of her need to do something fun and inventive which fits in with her busy life. She creates unique, one off cards and small art works with low tech printing techniques; cutting and collaging images using recycled materials and including beautiful Japanese and hand marbled papers. Maita loves creating quirky and humorous images which express her sense of design and humour. Maita's work can be found at Room 212, the cornucopia of Bristol artists on the Gloucester Road. She also exhibits on the West and North Bristol art trails.",

Techniques learned ranging from painter/writer Yuri Koval in the 1990's when living in Moscow, to the Hugo Grenville School of Painting, reflecting depth and poetry rather than \"record keeping\". She aims to paint freely, with rich designs, and heartfelt subjects. Laura is well known in Bristol as a city scape painter, and worked closely with the Grand Appeal charity over the years, painting Gromits, and Shauns and even a Wow! Gorilla. In recent years she has been exploring botanical themes inspired by her garden and daily woodland walks with her whippet. Drawn to the abstract, her work offers a bridge between reality and abstraction, fused with a strong sense of design and love of colour.",

The drawings are transferred onto a screen (a fine mesh stretched over a frame) and then printed by hand using a squeegee to draw the printing ink through the mesh onto the paper. One of my intentions when making a picture is that in the process of making, which is a kind of magical process, it will come to life in some way, in the sense that it will surprise me, or suggest a story or idea that is unexpected. My prints have been exhibited nationally and internationally, including The Royal Academy Summer Exhibition and The Royal West of England Autumn Open. Awards include the British Institution Fund award, and the NADFAS award for printmaking.",
