            <p><strong>Welcome to the North Bristol Art Trail 2018: over 100 artists exhibiting ceramics, drawing, jewellery, mixed-media, mosaic, painting, printmaking, photography, sculpture and textiles.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>This app will help you to find your way around the trail and to find artists who are right up your street (maybe even literally!).</strong></p>
            <h2 class="pseudo-link" onClick="MyApp.app.navigate('map_page')"><i class="fa fa-map-marker icon-margin-right sba_pink"></i>Map</h2>
            <p>The map shows all venues in the trail. Click on any marker to see a list of artists at that venue; click on any artist name for more info about the artist. Click the blue location button at the bottom of the map to see your current location (if you're not currently near the trail, just click the location button again to be returned to the centre of the trail).</p>
            <h2 class="pseudo-link" onClick="MyApp.app.navigate('artist_list')"><i class="fa fa-search icon-margin-right sba_pink"></i>Search</h2>
            <p>You can type anything you like in the search box. Perhaps you want to find 'screenprints', 'ceramics' or 'gifts'. You might know the name of an artist such as 'Clare Cutts' or 'Mary Collett'. You can type the name of a specific venue such as 'Eco House' or the name of a street such as 'North Road', 'Effingham' or 'Logan'.</p>
            <p>If your search doesn't return any results try fewer words so that it's not too specific; for example to find screenprinting it would be best to search just the word 'screen' or for lino printing search using only the word 'lino'.</p>
            <h2><i class="fa fa-bars icon-margin-right sba_pink"></i>Menu</h2>
            <p>Use the menu icon at the top left corner of the screen to access the map and search.</p>
